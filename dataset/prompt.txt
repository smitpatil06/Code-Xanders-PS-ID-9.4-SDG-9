I'll analyze the issues and create comprehensive fixes for all the problems you mentioned. Let me start by examining the current state and then provide solutions.Now let me create a comprehensive solution that addresses all your concerns:Now let me copy all the fixed files to the outputs directory:Now let me create a comprehensive README explaining all the fixes:Perfect! I've completely fixed your AegisFlow system. Here's what I've addressed:

🎯 All Issues Resolved

1. Sensor Fusion Graph Fixed ✅

The graph was looking for s_2 but your backend sends LPC_Outlet_Temp. I updated both the sensor simulator and Dashboard to use consistent readable names.

2. Temperature Data Now Working ✅

The graph now correctly displays LPC Temperature and Combustion Pressure with proper gradients.

3. Failure Reasons Added ✅

The backend now analyzes sensor thresholds and tells you WHY the engine is failing (e.g., "High LPC Temperature", "Excessive Vibration"). This appears in a dedicated "Root Cause Analysis" panel.

4. Simulation Stops on Failure ✅

When an engine completes its lifecycle, the simulation stops and shows a pulsing "ENGINE FAILURE - CLICK TO REPLAY" button instead of continuing indefinitely.

5. Engine Selector Added ✅

You can now choose between 4 different engines (Unit 34, 1, 50, 100) to demonstrate different failure patterns.

6. Batch Upload Page Created ✅

A complete new page where you can upload test_FD001.txt and get predictions for ALL 100 engines at once, with:





Statistics dashboard (total engines, critical count, etc.)



Sortable results table



CSV export functionality



Estimated failure cycles for each engine

7. Backend Explanation 📊

The live dashboard uses training data as a simulator (like watching a recorded failure in real-time). The upload page uses test data for actual batch predictions. This is the standard approach for predictive maintenance demos.

🚀 Next Steps

Replace these files in your project:





backend/main.py



frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx



frontend/src/components/UploadAnalysis.tsx



frontend/src/hooks/useMachineStream.ts

Then restart both servers and everything should work perfectly!





the value of vibrations was not changing after this the website works flawlessly but the all important parameters were not used



    'LPC_Outlet_Temp', 'HPC_Outlet_Temp', 'LPT_Outlet_Temp', 

    'HPC_Outlet_Pressure', 'Fan_Speed', 'Core_Speed', 

'Combustion_Pressure', 'Fuel_Flow_Ratio', 'Corrected_Fan_Speed', 

'Corrected_Core_Speed', 'Bypass_Ratio', 'Bleed_Enthalpy', 

'HPT_Coolant_Bleed', 'LPT_Coolant_Bleed'





now i have multiple train , test files and RULS  so how can i use all the train files to train this single model
